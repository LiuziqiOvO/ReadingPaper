As data centers face increasing sustainability demands, such as reduced carbon emissions, efficient management of Flash overprovisioning and endurance has become crucial. Our analysis demonstrates that mixing data with different lifetimes on Flash blocks results in high device garbage collection costs, which either reduce device lifetime or necessitate host overprovisioning. Targeted data placement on Flash to minimize data intermixing and thus device write amplification shows promise for addressing this issue."

In this study, we explore the feasibility, benefits, and limitations of leveraging NVMe FDP primitives for data placement on Flash media in CacheLib, a popular open- source Flash cache widely deployed and used in Meta's software ecosystem as a caching building block. We demonstrate that targeted data placement in CacheLib using NVMe FDP SSDs helps reduce device write amplification, embodied carbon emissions, and power consumption with almost no overhead to other metrics. Using multiple production traces and their configurations from Meta and Twitter, we show that an ideal device write amplification of "

These web services range across various domains e.g., social networks, microblogging platforms, and emerging IoT applications, to name a few [23, 27, 48, 59]. The challenges in the design of the caching solutions for this domain are (1) the large working set size and (2) the problem of caching objects of different sizes, especially dominated by numerous small- sized objects [23, 48, 59]. The use of Flash- based SSDs has become popular in the design of these caches given their excellent performance cost tradeoff compared to DRAM and HDD [23, 32, 48, 56, 58]. However, managing the limited write endurance of Flash in these caches remains a challenge [36, 39, 42]. To maximize Flash lifetime in Flash caches, extensive research has gone into admission policies, application write amplification, and caching algorithms. However, the problem of device- level write amplification (DLWA) in Flash caches has not received much attention."

As multiple data center operators e.g., Amazon [2], Google [5], Meta [14], and Microsoft [49] are aiming to achieve Net Zero greenhouse emissions, they are focusing on cutting down on embodied carbon emissions. Reductions in embodied carbon emission will constitute the bulk of data center emissions post their switch to renewable sources of energy [34]. Since Flash is more carbon- efficient than DRAM per bit [34, 57], it is important to cache more data in Flash than DRAM and increase the lifetime of Flash devices for carbon- efficient deployment of Flash caches at scale."

Our key insight is that the high invalidation rate of set- associative cache design over a small LBA space can be harnessed along with device overprovisioning to ensure the availability of spare blocks for writing new incoming data for it. This is important in maintaining a low predictable DLWA and reduces embodied carbon emissions."

Our experiments demonstrate that data separation in flash caches can result in a 2x reduction in SSD device costs and a 4x reduction in embodied carbon footprint. Moreover, our results also highlight opportunities to reduce the DRAM sizes in Flash cache deployments and explore multi- tenant deployments that were not possible earlier due to host overprovisioning. At scale, this translates to massive cost benefits and embodied carbon emission reductions."

We review the concepts of the FDP storage interface, its limitations, and its connection to previous data placement proposals (Section 3). We analyze the advantages of data segregation by leveraging FDP features in Flash cache architectures equipped with specialized engines for storing objects of varying sizes (Section 4). Additionally, we present a theoretical model to quantify DLWA. We present the design and implementation details of Flash cache data segregation by incorporating FDP features into CacheLib, a popular state- of- the- art open- source caching library, without altering its architecture or user- facing API (Section 5).

NAND SSDs cannot be directly overwritten due to the erase before write property. The erase operation happens in terms of erase blocks (EBs) (tens to hundreds of MBs) while the writes happen in terms of pages (16KB, 48KB, 64 KB, etc.). The Flash Translation Layer (FTL) in SSDs handles the overwrites by (1) writing (programming) the new data in a free page; (2) invalidating the old data, and (3) updating the metadata to point to the new data. The metadata translates the logical addresses to physical addresses in the NAND media. Writing to logical addresses in an SSD creates invalid pages, that have to be reclaimed by a process called Garbage Collection (GC)."

Flash- based SSDs have become popular for caching large working sets of popular web services [23, 32, 56, 58] due to their excellent price performance tradeoff compared to DRAM and HDD. Caching on Flash is write- intensive since evictions upon read from DRAM translate to writes on Flash. Writes to Flash caches increase with the size of the working set, churn in keys, and reduction of DRAM sizes in the deployment. However, the limited write endurance of Flash coupled with unpredictable workloads pose a challenge in the design of these caches."

It is a merger of Google's SmartPTL [52] and Meta's Direct Placement Mode proposals to enable data placement on Flash media without the high software engineering costs of explicit garbage collection of ZNS [24] and low- level media control of Open- Channel SSD proposals [25]. It borrows elements from the multi- streamed SSD interface [40] that was proposed a decade ago but did not really take off due to a lack of industry and academic interest. It has been designed with backward compatibility in mind so that applications can work unchanged with it. The choice of leveraging data placement and evaluating its costs and benefits has been left "

If all the data in a RU is invalidated, then the RU is erased for future writes and no logical blocks have to copied across RUs upon garbage collection. Since the host software can only access RUHs and not an RU, in order to perform fine- grained and targeted deallocation of RUs, the host software needs to track the LBAs that have been written to an RU together and deallocate those.

Consequently, the host has no control over the garbage collection process in the SSD, aside from invalidating LBAs by deallocating or overwriting them. Note that this limitation only applies in scenarios where the host can achieve greater performance gains by managing garbage collection more efficiently than the SSD, rather than focusing solely on data placement."

A smaller SOC size on devices leads to fewer buckets and a higher rate of key collisions. Since the entire SOC bucket of 4KB is written out, a larger SOC bucket invalidation rate is SSD- friendly because it leads to more SSD page invalidation. If only invalidated SOC data resided in an SSD erase block, this would result in the entire erase block freeing itself up and not needing movement of valid data. For workloads dominant in small object accesses, a high invalidation of SOC happens but the SOC data in erase blocks is intermixed with LOC data. This prevents the SSD from taking advantage of the updates occurring in the SOC buckets over a small LBA space."

Additionally, we use the fact that only SOC data will use the device overprovisioning space and item insertions to the SOC buckets follow a uniform hash function. To simplify our analysis, we assume that the uniform hash function used in CacheLib is fairly well- behaved. Modelling DLWA by estimating live data movement for a uniform random workload has been used proposed before [30]. We extend that methodology to model the SOC DLWA that translates to the DLWA for FDP- enabled CacheLib as the LOC does not contribute to DLWA.

We use the I/O Passthru [11, 38] mechanism to send FDP- enabled I/Os to the Linux kernel. We use an io_uring [22] queue pair per worker thread so that I/Os can be sent to the kernel without synchronization or concurrency challenges in the submission and completion queues of io_uring.

We explored the notion of a specialized FDP eviction policy for CacheLib by building reclaim unit size awareness in the region-based eviction policy of the LOC. The FDP specification provides the required semantics for the host to track writes to a reclaim unit. Utilizing it, we can track the LOC regions that belong to a reclaim unit and invalidate multiple regions in a reclaim unit together. This can be paired with a TRIP command to free an entire reclaim unit and aid the garbage collection process on the SSD. Early exploration of this policy showed minimal gains and was shelved. We speculate that such a policy could be beneficial in cases where reclaim units are smaller in size."

The DLWA gains also aid in improving the operational efficiency of SSDs due to fewer device garbage collection operations. This results in a reduction in operational carbon emissions. In this section, we discuss the promise of FDP as a sustainable solution to combat carbon emissions."

To tackle device- level write amplification (DLWA), SSD controllers use various heuristics to segregate data based on its characteristics (e.g., access patterns, temperature, etc.) on Flash media to minimize garbage collection and data movement costs [28, 33]. There have been various proposals in the NVMe data placement space for cooperation between host and FTL to leverage host application domain knowledge. One approach is to pass hints to the FTL as proposed in Multi- Streamed SSDs [40]. Another contrary approach proposed in Open- Channel SSDs [25] and DFS [37] is to expose the SSD internals completely paving the way for host- based FTLs. There have also been software- defined Flash proposals to expose NAND channels in SDF [50] and to explore alternative storage abstractions that can be leveraged by key- value stores [43]."

Despite impressive DLWA results, the append- only write model and host- based garbage collection imposes upfront software engineering costs for applications that do not conform to log- structured access patterns. This has posed a challenge for the wide adoption of ZNS. FDP TP [19] was proposed based on lessons learned from the past. It consolidates Google's SmartFTL [52] and Meta's Direct Placement Mode proposals to fill the cost- benefit gap between ZNS and conventional SSDs. The concept of RUHs in FDP borrows heavily from the concept of streams in multistreamed SSDs. FDP was crafted with backward compatibility in mind, enabling an application storage stack to operate seamlessly without modifications. Additionally, applications have the option to harness FDP features by opting to enable them. FDP also does not introduce any new command sets. In this work, we have leveraged FDP features for data placement using Linux kernel I/O Passthru features [11, 38]. The backward compatibility of FDP and its ease of integration into the CacheLib software have been key drivers in the upstreaming process of our work."

Their inadequacy for hybrid caching use cases at Meta that are dominated by random writes of small objects causing severe DLWA has been previously highlighted [24, 48]. Log- structured caches [32, 54] designed for Flash to minimize write amplification suffer from DRAM overhead issues (especially for numerous small items) which formed the motivation for the work in Kangaroo [48]. Our present work is complementary to these efforts because we keep the cache architecture and design of CacheLib [23] unchanged and leverage FDP features for data placement in its I/O write paths to minimize DLWA. FairyWren [47] extended Kangaroo to integrate ZNS devices for lower DLWA. We observe similar DLWA and carbon emission gains through data placement alone, without modifying the original architecture and design of CacheLib."

This results in massive cost (2x) and carbon emission (4x) reductions at scale. The reduction in DLWA, along with increased device utilization, opens up new deployment opportunities for hybrid caches that were previously unfeasible. For example, this approach can reduce DRAM consumption while enabling SSD sharing in multi- tenant settings. Our work to isolate data using FDP in a state- of- the- art Flash cache, CacheLib has already been merged in the upstream repository. This highlights its impact and the appeal of reduced engineering cost of FDP SSDs for Flash caches where data placement is key to reduce their DLWA and carbon emissions."

This results in a purely sequential write pattern of LBAs to the SSD.- With FDP, the LOC writes are written into a separate RU and physical block. The purely sequential write pattern of LOC and its segregation into a separate physical block and RU means that LOC data invalidates itself nicely and contributes to negligible (or no) live data movement.- Items are inserted into the SOC buckets using a uniform hash function. Every SOC item insertion results in the entire hashed bucket (a 4KB page) being written. While a modulo is not purely sequential, for this model we assume that the SOC generates a uniform random write pattern.- With FDP, all SOC data is segregated into a separate RU and physical block. The random nature of SOC writes means that its data contributes to live data movement.- As the LOC writes are sequential and will not need any live data movement, it is safe to assume that only SOC writes contribute to device- level write amplification.- The SSD has some amount of overprovisioning space.- In the case of FDP, since the physical blocks and RUs that contain LOC data free themselves up due to the sequential write pattern, we assume that the overprovisioned space can be entirely used by the writes from SOC data."
