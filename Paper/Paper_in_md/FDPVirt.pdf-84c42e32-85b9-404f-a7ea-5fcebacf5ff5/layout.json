A key issue is managing WAF, which affects both endurance and efficiency. Flexible Data Placement (FDP) [1] has emerged as a promising solution, aligning data with its expected lifespan, reducing data movement during Garbage Collection (GC), and improving overall SSD performance. However, the lack of prototype devices with FDP functionality limits academic research. To address this, we propose FDPVirt, an SSD emulator based on NVMeVirt [3], designed to emulate and evaluate FDP strategies without relying on real hardware."

To satisfy this requirement, FDPVirt extends the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) of NVMeVirt as shown in Figure 1. In the figure, each line (e.g., L0, L1, etc.) in the FTL represents a flash block, corresponding to a RU in FDP. These RUs allow efficient management by enabling independent reclamation during GC, thus reducing WAF. To implement FDP, we expand the Write Pointer (WP) system in FDPVirt. Rather than using a single WP, FDPVirt utilizes an array of WPs, where each WP points to a specific RU. This design enables dynamic data placement across multiple RUs, with data grouped by expected lifespan. The key to reducing WAF in FDPVirt lies in its fine- grained data placement, which minimizes the movement of long- lived data during GC, thus reducing internal writes and improving write performance and device endurance."

As shown in Figure 3a, the latency distribution of both devices are remarkably similar, demonstrating the accuracy of FDPVirt in emulating real- world FDP device behavior under typical workloads. To evaluate the accuracy of emulation during SSD GC, we perform random writes followed by warming up (i.e., fill the whole device space with sequential writes). As seen in Figure 3b, both FDPVirt and the real device experience similar performance drops during GC, with FDPVirt closely replicating the real device's behavior, maintaining a steady performance after the initial drop. This further validates the effectiveness of FDPVirt in mimicking real- world conditions."

In this evaluation, we use mixed workloads with various levels of hotness. To generate different hotness, each application thread submits I/Os at a different rate to its dedicated LBA range (i.e., higher I/O rate, hotter temperature). We group workloads that have similar hotness and make each group share the same RU. By distributing RUs to application threads in this manner, a higher number of RUs induces finer data placement by hotness. Because actively triggered GC is required to show the impact of fine- grained data placement on WAF, we sequentially fill the whole SSD space, before submitting writes with different hotness. As depicted in Figure 4, increasing the number of RUs leads to a reduction in WAF, with improvements "
