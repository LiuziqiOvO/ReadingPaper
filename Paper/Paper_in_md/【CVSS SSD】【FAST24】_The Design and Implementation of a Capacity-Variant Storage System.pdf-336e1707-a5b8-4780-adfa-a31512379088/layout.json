CVSS aims to maintain high performance throughout the lifetime of an SSD by allowing storage capacity to gracefully reduce over time, thus preventing fail- slow symptoms. The CVSS comprises three key components: (1) CV- SSD, an SSD that minimizes write amplification and gracefully reduces its exported capacity with age; (2) CV- FS, a log- structured file system for elastic logical partition; and (3) CV- manager, a user- level program that orchestrates system components based on the state of the storage system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CVSS with synthetic and real workloads, and show its significant improvements in latency, throughput, and lifetime compared to a fixed- capacity storage system. Specifically, under real workloads, CVSS reduces the latency, improves the throughput, and extends the lifetime by "

More specifically, an SSD's failure unit is an individual flash memory block [3, 44, 50], and the SSD- internal wear leveling algorithms are artifacts to emulate a hard disk drive- like fail- stop behavior [25, 31]. Second, an SSD has no other choice but to trade performance as flash memory's reliability deteriorates, because a storage device's capacity remains fixed and unchanged from its newly installed state until its retirement. SSD's internal data re- reads [4, 5, 42, 53] or preventive re- writes [6, 18] are such choices that lead to fail- slow symptoms [30, 31]."

The first component is a file system (CV- FS) that dynamically tunes the logical partition size based on the aged state of the storage device. CVFS is designed to reduce capacity in an online, fine- grained manner and carefully manage user data to avoid data loss. The device- level component, CV- SSD, maintains its performance and reliability by mapping out aged and poor- performing blocks. Without needing to maintain fixed capacity, CV- SSD simplifies flash management firmware, avoids fail- slow symptoms, and extends its lifetime. Lastly, the user- level component, CV- manager, provides necessary interfaces to the host for capacity variance. Users can set performance and reliability requirements for the device through commands, and the CV- manager then adaptively orchestrates CV- FS and the underlying CV- SSD."

Our design consists of user-level, kernel-level, and device-level components that collectively allow the system to maintain performance and extend its lifetime. (Â§ 3)- We develop a framework that allows for a full-stack study on fail-slow symptoms in SSDs over a long time, from start to failure. This framework provides a comprehensive model of SSD internals and aging behavior over the entire lifetime of SSDs. (Â§ 4)- We evaluate and quantitatively demonstrate the benefits of capacity variance using a set of synthetic and real-world I/O workloads throughout the SSD's entire lifetime. Capacity variance avoids the fail-slow symptoms and can significantly extend the SSD's lifetime. (Â§ 5)"

Fail- slow symptoms are caused by the SSD's effort to correct errors [4, 5, 42, 53] and prevent the accumulation of errors [6, 18]. Because SSDs are commonly used as the performance tier in storage systems where the identification and removal of ill- performing drives are critical, fail- slow symptoms in SSDs have gained significant attention recently. Prior research in this area can be categorized into three types. The first group focuses on developing machine learning (ML) models to quickly identify SSDs experiencing fail- slow symptoms [7, 22, 61, 66, 67]. Various models, including neural networks [22], autoencoders [7], LSTM [67], feature ranking [61], and random forest [66], have been explored with varying accuracy and efficacy. The second group aims to isolate and remove ailing drives using mechanisms deployed in large- scale systems, identified through ML [40] or system monitoring [21, 52]. The third group proposes modifications to the interface to reject slow I/O and send hedging requests to a different node [20] or drive [38]."

Furthermore, as SSDs evolve and new error mechanisms emerge (e.g., lateral charge spreading [36] and vertical and horizontal variability [56]), older ML models become obsolete, making it difficult to reap the benefits of fail- slow prediction. Most critically, these prior approaches only treat the symptoms and fail to consider the underlying cause: the flash error mechanism."

Lastly, the file abstraction to the applications hides the remaining space left on storage. A file is simply a sequence of bytes, and file system metadata such as utilization and remaining space is readily available to the system administrator."

When logical capacity should be reduced, the file system identifies an available range of free space from the end of the logical partition and then restricts the user from using it, for example, by marking that as allocated. With this approach, the adjustment of logical capacity can be efficiently achieved with minimal upfront costs, as the primary task involved is allocating the readily available free space.

Upon receiving the remap command, the FTL first finds the PPN associated with LPN5 (PPN6 in our case) and updates the logical- to- physical (L2P) mapping of L3 to PPN6. Finally, the old L2P mapping of L5 is invalidated, and the new physical- to- logical (P2L) mapping of PPN6 is recorded in the NVRAM of the SSD.

WL is an artifact designed to maintain an illusion of a fixed- capacity device wherein its underlying storage components (i.e., flash memory blocks) either all work or fail, opposing our goal of allowing partial failure."

Flash memory blocks in SSDs wear out at different rates and are marked as bad blocks by the bad block manager when they are no longer usable [26, 50]. This means that the physical capacity of the SSD naturally reduces over time, and for a fixed- capacity SSD, the entire storage device is considered to have reached the end of its life when the number of bad blocks exceeds its reserved space. On the other hand, the capacity- variant SSD's lifetime is defined by the amount of data stored in the SSD, rather than the initial logical capacity, making it a more reliable and efficient option."

Implementing these policies can cause a large number of blocks with the same erase count to map out simultaneously, leading to excessive capacity loss, and the device may suddenly fail.

Type II will also not affect the performance when data are fetched by the host because of the low RBER of young blocks. Moreover, with CV- SSD's allocation policy, such write- intensive data are inevitably re- written by the file system to the middle- aged blocks and the type II blocks will be GC- ed due to their low valid ratio. This type of scenario also happens under the early stages of CV- SSD, in which most blocks are young. Lastly, type III is the case where we need to pay more attention: read- intensive data should be stored in young blocks; otherwise expensive error correction techniques are triggered more often."

The evaluation comparisons are selected based on their broader applicability and implementation simplicity of the multi- stream interface (represented by AutoStream [63]) and the fast- fail mechanism (represented by ttFlash [62]). These approaches align with more general and widely used methods such as PCStream [33], LinnOS [22], and IODA [38]. Specifically, AutoStream [63] uses the multi- stream interface [28] and automatically assigns a stream ID to the data based on the I/O access pattern. The SSD then places data accordingly based on the assigned ID to reduce write amplification and thus, improve performance. On the other hand, ttFlash [62] reduces the tail latency of SSDs by utilizing a redundancy "

Prior to each experiment, we use impression [1] to generate a representative aged file system layout. After the system aging, the fast- forwardable SSD aging framework (FF- SSD) [26] is used to reach different aged states for SSD.

In particular, 0 represents the case where no performance requirement is applied so the workload runs until the underlying SSD is unusable. In cases of lower device utilization (as shown in Figures 15a and 15c), CVSS effectively extends the device lifetime, even when high performance is required. In Figure 15a, the device fails after accommodating 10 TB host writes for TrSS and 18 TB for AutoStream, considering the performance requirement of 0.8. On the other hand, CVSS accommodates 28 TB host writes with the same performance "

Lastly, for desktop users, capacity variance extends the lifetime of SSDs significantly and thus reduces the overall cost of storage."

Specifically, due to a wear- out, a device may (1) choose to take a zone offline, or (2) report a new, smaller size for a zone after a reset. Both of these result in a shrinking capacity SSD. However, there is no software that can handle capacity reduction for ZNS- SSDs currently. The offline command simply makes a zone inaccessible and data relocation has to be done by users. Moreover, file systems are typically unaware of this change except for ZoneFS [34]. The capacity- variant SSD interface is a more streamlined solution where the software and the hardware cooperate to automate the process."
