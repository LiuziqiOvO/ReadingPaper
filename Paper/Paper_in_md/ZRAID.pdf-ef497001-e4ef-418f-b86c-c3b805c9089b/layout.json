However, constructing a RAID system using ZNS SSDs presents a significant challenge in managing partial parity for incomplete stripes. Previous research permanently logs partial parity in a limited number of reserved zones, which not only creates bottlenecks in throughput but also exacerbates write amplification, thereby reducing the device's lifetime. We refer to these inefficiencies as the partial parity tax."

ZRWA enables in- place updates within a confined area near the write pointer. ZRAID temporarily stores partial parity within the ZRWA of data zones. Thus, partial parity writes are distributed across multiple data zones, effectively eliminating throughput bottlenecks. Furthermore, any expired partial parity in the ZRWA is overwritten by subsequent data, avoiding unnecessary flash writes. With the introduction of ZRWA, ZRAID can leverage general schedulers, overcoming the queue depth limitations of ZNS- compatible schedulers. Our evaluation with actual ZNS SSDs demonstrates a significant improvement in write throughput: up to "

The ZNS interface organizes the storage space into distinct zones that only support sequential write operations, exposing write pointers to the host [5, 9, 15]. The host is required to submit write requests at the designated write pointer of a zone, with the pointer incrementally advancing in the size of each write request. Additionally, the responsibility of managing zone erasures for reuse, a task previously handled by the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) in conventional SSDs, now falls to the host. While this approach does increase management tasks for the host, it also effectively reduces the internal overhead and costs associated with SSDs. Due to its competitive pricing and predictable performance, ZNS SSDs are particularly attractive within the data center storage market [7, 14]."

Writing data that is not aligned with stripe boundaries leads to the generation of an incomplete, partial stripe that also necessitates protection via partial parity (referred to interchangeably as PP). The partial parity cannot be written directly to the corresponding stripe's parity location because it needs to be updated when subsequent data belonging to that stripe arrives. Consequently, partial parities should be managed in a separate, dedicated area in a persistent manner until the full stripe's data becomes available."

When the full stripe is ready, the driver can calculate the full parity and write it to the parity area in the ZNS SSD. However, this approach is not acceptable in data center environments due to the potential risk of data loss on a sudden power failure. By employing Non- Volatile Memory (NVM) such as Optane, the risk of data loss inherent in the previous scheme can be avoided. While this approach enhances data reliability, it incurs additional costs and introduces a dependency on specific hardware components that have been discontinued from production."

This approach, however, causes a bottleneck in write throughput as partial parities from numerous data zones are directed toward significantly fewer partial parity zones. Moreover, permanently storing partial parities wastes valuable device resources and incurs zone management overhead. We refer to the additional overheads that arise from managing partial parities in ZNS RAID as the partial parity tax. It encapsulates the additional resource consumption and potential performance impacts of ensuring data durability with partial parity in ZNS RAID, where data cannot be directly overwritten. In addition to these overheads, it is also observed that existing ZNS RAID systems share the ZNS SSD's inherent limitation of a restricted queue depth, while further contributing to the reduction in throughput."

By leveraging the Zone Random Write Area (ZRWA) feature of ZNS SSDs, ZRAID not only alleviates the partial parity tax, but also boosts the efficiency and performance of ZNS- based RAID systems. ZRAID temporarily stores partial parity within the ZRWA of the originating data zone, which is then quickly overwritten by subsequent data writes. This design effectively distributes the writing of partial parities across multiple data zones, avoiding the need for separate parity zones as employed in the existing ZNS RAID systems. Since partial parities only exist until they are overwritten by data, there is no need to store them permanently on flash media. Moreover, ZRAID enables the use of general disk schedulers, increasing the queue depth for write operations and consequently boosting write throughput further by utilizing the ZRWA feature."

This backing storage is usually made of battery- backed DRAM or SLC (SingleLevel Cell) flash memory. Both options offer substantially higher endurance and superior performance compared to TLC (Triple- Level Cell) or QLC (Quad- Level Cell) technologies, which currently dominate or are expected to dominate the mainstream flash storage market [4]. In this scheme, overwritten data in the ZRWA is not flushed to the main flash area but instead expires within the ZRWA's backing storage. Thus, ZRWA is well- suited to handle short- lived data, thereby enhancing performance, optimizing flash space utilization, and extending the device's overall lifetime."

PP blocks from partial stripes are appended to the PP zone of the parity device.

However, it presents a traditional block interface to the host by mapping logical block addresses to the physical block addresses of the underlying ZNS SSDs, requiring complex metadata management. ZapRAID also stores block metadata for fault tolerance in the flash page's out- ofband area, which limits its general applicability. Furthermore, it is implemented using SPDK, making it incompatible with kernel- based file systems like F2FS. A key difference between ZapRAID and RAIZN lies in their consistency policies. ZapRAID writes parity only when the stripe is complete, while delaying the completion of stripe- unaligned writes. These differences complicate direct performance comparisons between ZapRAID and ZNS RAID systems."

Although these headers are very small in size, they pose an issue because they must be written in the device's minimum block size (e.g., 4KB in ZN540). This significantly increases the volume of writes, particularly affecting small- sized write workloads. For instance, a 4KB write request generates a 4KB PP block and its 4KB metadata header block, reaching a write amplification factor of three. In our evaluation, we also observed that RAIZN reaches a WAF of 2.44 due to the overhead introduced by PP- related blocks when running the varmaIl workload on F2FS, which primarily generates small- size writes to the RAID array."

Each write holds the lock for its target zone at dispatch and releases it upon completion, preventing other writes to the same zone during this interval. This mechanism limits the effective per- zone write queue depth to one, severely hurting performance. Conversely, the ordering constraints are relaxed within the ZRWA, eliminating the need for ZNScompatible scheduler enforcement. This allows for the use of a generic scheduler such as no- op, enabling operations at higher queue depths within a single zone."

During recovery, if inconsistencies among WPs are identified, the space corresponding to the protruded WP is allocated in the superblock zone. A mapping to this space is then stored in both the memory cache and the superblock zone, redirecting subsequent read/write operations to the newly allocated area in the superblock zone. This recovery method effectively resolves the write atomicity challenge in the short term. However, over time, cumulative redirections can complicate the garbage collection process and potentially create an I/O bottleneck within the superblock zone."

First, a PP chunk precedes any data chunk in the associated partial stripe, thereby ensuring no device is shared between them. This guarantees tolerance against the event of a single device failure. Second, in a RAID- 5 setup, the rotational nature of the array sequence ensures that PP chunks are evenly distributed across all devices. Third, writing the last data chunk in a stripe or the full parity chunk does not generate a PP chunk. This indicates that the PP chunk locations in the ZRWA corresponding to these two chunks are never utilized for PP chunks. Hence, these spaces are reserved for metadata areas to handle corner cases (see §5.1 and §5.3)."

This approach offers significant benefits in both space and time. By avoiding persistent storage of PP chunks in dedicated zones, ZRAID reduces unnecessary space usage and eliminates the need for garbage collection in those zones. It also frees up active zone resources previously reserved for PP storage, making them available for data zones. Furthermore, since the ZRWA is typically implemented using fast, high- endurance DRAM or SLC flash memory, ZRAID enhances write performance and extends device lifespan."

This innovative strategy addresses the significant challenge of managing partial parity for incomplete stripes, which has traditionally resulted in throughput bottlenecks and increased write amplification. By temporarily storing partial parity within the ZRWA of data zones, ZRAID effectively distributes these writes across multiple zones, thus eliminating the bottlenecks associated with reserving dedicated zones for partial parity. Additionally, this method ensures that expired partial parity is overwritten by subsequent data, avoiding unnecessary flash writes and enhancing the longevity of the SSDs."
